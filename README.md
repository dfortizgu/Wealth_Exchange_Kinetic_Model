# Wealth Exchange Kinetic Model.

In the PDF file present in this repository is the final version (in spanish) of a replication project of the paper "*Non-conservative kinetic model of wealth exchange with saving of pro-
duction*" by D. S. Quevedo and C. J. Quimbay. The theoretical and analytical development was made by Brayan Elian Castiblanco Ortigoza, Jaime Andres Cocunubo and me, David Francisco Ortiz Gutierrez. The numerical simulation and data analysis is implemented in Python by me, David Francisco Ortiz Gutierrez.
